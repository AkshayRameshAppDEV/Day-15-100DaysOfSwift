## Review Day 15:

### 1. Properties
  - Structs and class have property
  - They are declared first usually on start before init and any other functions
  - didSet(called first) and willSet(called after willSet) - these methods are property observers which updates values when property changes
  - Computed properties - computes some calculation and sets the computed value for property
  - computed property get or set

### 2. Static and Access control
  - Static methods and properties - can be called directly using struct/class name and cant be called on using instances
  - private - property can be private and can be only used within the class.
  
### 3. Polymorphism and Type Casting
  - Both classes type at the same time
  - everything referes to parent type
  - The subclass never lose their class status and they always use overriden methods
  - Convert to class type using as?
  - primitive type using initializers

### 4. Closures
  - variable holding functions and also params associated with it
  - aka Anonymous functions
  - Trailing closures
